        It would be easy for us to simply come up with fake numbers for Burmese farmers, but we wanted to actually base it on
        close to reality numbers. The two quantities we focues  on were water and Nitrogen.
       </p>
    <h1> Water</h1>
    <h3> Evapotranspiration </h3>
        <p>
        Evapotranspiration is the water lost due to climatic factors. It depends on the month as well as the latitude of the farm. 
        We got the data for month directly from the Date() Java library, while Latitude was assumed to be around 20ÂºN. We assumed
        this because of both the fact that much of the farming in Myanmar occurs around this latitude combined with the fact that
        the sunlight factors do not change much over small increments of latitude. With this data combine with average temperature 
        data for the region, we calclated the Evapotranspiration or <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?ET_o" border="0"/> .

        Equation: <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?ET_o = p (0.46 T_{mean} +8)" border="0"/>
