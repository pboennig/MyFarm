# MyFarm
MyFarm is an application for farmers in Myanmar that helps them manage their plots and farms of land. In response to the KPCB Social Good challenge at 
the Los Altos Hacks Hackathon, we built this.

##Features
*   Water Management - Taking into account evaportranspiration and the crop factors, we calculate the liters necessary per day to farm a plot
*   Nitrogen Enrichment - Based off crop and fertilizer type, exact amount of fertilizer needed is returned
*   Plot Management - Farmers can delineate and manage plots, focusing on crop rotation
*   Scheduling - How long and when to harvest a certain plot and crop
